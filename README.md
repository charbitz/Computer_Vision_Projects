# Description
This repo contains all 4 requested homeworks of the course **Computer Vision** of the 7th semester.

* **This repo is for demonstration purposes only**

## HW1 - Document Image Analysis

* Sub-text areas detection with bounding boxes.
* Information measurements of each sub-text area.

## HW2 - Panorama Image Stitching

* Using SIFT and SURF descriptors.
* Using Image Composite Editor.
* Compare the results.

## HW3 - Multi-Classs Image Classification using BOVW

* Creation of a visual vocabulary based on the ***Bag Of Visual Words*** model using the K-Means algorithm.
* Extraction of BOVW Descriptor for every image of the training dataset.
* Using classifiers k-nn and SVM (with the confidence criterion of One vs All).
* Classification assessment using test set and check of the effects of number k of neigbours and kernel type of SVM.

## HW4 - Multi-Classs Image Classification using CNN in Keras-Tensorflow

* Using a non-pretrained NN.
* Using a pretrained MobileNet.
* Classification assessment of both architectures using validation-test set.

## Image Datasets
* HW1: Scanned documents with and without noise (salt and peper).
* HW2: Custom images.
* HW3: [Caltech 256 Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/caltech256)
* HW4: [BelgiumTS - Belgian Traffic Sign Dataset](https://btsd.ethz.ch/shareddata/)
