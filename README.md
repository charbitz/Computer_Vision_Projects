## HW1 - Document Image Analysis

* Sub-text areas detection with bounding boxes.
* Information measurements of each sub-text area.

## HW2 - Panorama Image Stitching

* Using SIFT and SURF descriptors.
* Using Image Composite Editor.
* Compare the results.

## HW3 - Multi-Classs Image Classification
* Creation of a visual vocabulary based on the ***Bag Of Visual Words*** model using the K-Means algorithm.
* Extraction of BOVW Descriptor for every image of the training dataset.
* Using classifiers k-nn and SVM (with the confidence criterion of One vs All).
* Classification assessment using test set and check of the effects of number k of neigbours and kernel type of SVM.
